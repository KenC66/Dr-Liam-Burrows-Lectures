DL for classification, denoising and segmentation
               Liam's lectures codes from  https://github.com/LRB13/CMIT_Lectures_2023
               
HERE ** Lecture 1**
Liam1.py is a plain python file to do the same code using two models (FCN / CNN)
    demo for biginners... (essentially the same as https://github.com/LRB13/CMIT_Lectures_2023/blob/main/lec1_2023.ipynb)

** Lecture 2**
Lec2_2023.py (modified to Lec2_seg) is also a plain python file for segmentation of retina images by UNET or CNN, while
Lec2_denoise.py (modified to Lec2_den) is a plain python file for image noise removal by CNN (Lecture 1/2).
